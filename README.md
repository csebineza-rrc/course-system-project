This project is a full-stack course management system designed to help me strengthen
my skills in application development. The goal is to build a structured backend using
concepts such as controllers, services, models, and routes, while also learning how 
to connect it to a frontend interface. By working on this project, I can practice 
real-world development workflows and build confidence with full-stack architecture.

The backend portion of the system will focus on creating a reliable REST API that 
supports common operations such as adding courses, enrolling students, retrieving data, 
and managing information efficiently. It is structured in a way that mirrors professional
development patterns, preparing me for advanced learning in backend engineering 
and future full-stack courses.
